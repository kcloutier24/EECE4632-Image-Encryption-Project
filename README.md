Your final report describing your project
Code: Python, C, JupyterNotebooks, and bit files so we can run the code.  Be sure to submit your CPP code. 
Instructions on how to run your code
Inputs to run your code on or a link regarding where to find them

## The final report describing this prjoect is attatched.

### Code submitted with this project is 
- JuypterNotebook, this is where you will be running the code
- The python files from the begining of this project
 - I turned in the python notebook for convienence
 - this helped me plan my project in the begining and to get reference photos 
- .cpp files for
 - DCT hardware
 - Huffman hardware
- .bit .hwh. and .tcl files for
 - DCT overlay
 - Huffman overlay
- Example .png to use tho you are able to use any .png of choice


### Instructions on how to run:

- Move files to correct destination
- Run the notebook in order 
- The .bin file will be read in to hardware, first DCT then Huffman, to go through encoding then the results will be read into a .bin file
 - will also print timestamps as to how fast it ran 
- the results .bin file will be turned into a .png, will yield 3 images if run correctly 
 - dct image
 - huffman image
 - dct and huffman image
